        // what can happen is, now that UIView's -removeFromSuperview will remove the view from the active touch
        // instead of just cancel the touch (which is how I had implemented it previously - which was wrong), the
        // situation can arise where, in response to a touch event of some kind, the view may remove itself from its
        // superview in some fashion, which means that the handling of the touchesEnded:withEvent: (or whatever)
        // methods could somehow result in the view itself being destroyed before the method is even finished running!
        // I ran into this in particular with a load more button in Twitterrific which would crash in UIControl's
        // touchesEnded: implemention after sending actions to the registered targets (because one of those targets
        // ended up removing the button from view and thus reducing its retain count to 0). For some reason, even
        // though I attempted to rearrange stuff in UIControl so that actions were always the last thing done, it'd
        // still end up crashing when one of the internal methods returned to touchesEnded:, which didn't make sense
        // to me because there was no code after that (at the time) and therefore it should just have been unwinding
        // the stack to eventually get back here and all should have been okay. I never figured out exactly why that
        // crashed in that way, but by putting a retain here it works around this problem and perhaps others that have
        // gone so-far unnoticed. Converting to ARC should also work with this solution because there will be a local
        // strong reference to the view retainined throughout the rest of this logic and thus the same protection
        // against mid-method view destrustion should be provided under ARC. If someone can figure out some other,
        // better way to fix this without it having to have this hacky-feeling retain here, that'd be cool, but be
        // aware that this is here for a reason and that the problem it prevents is very rare and somewhat contrived.
